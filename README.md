The Songwe Region is the most recently created region, having been created from the western portion of the Mbeya region, seen here in the left-hand corner of Tanzania. Songwe is not picture here, which is beneficial to the understanding of this analysis, as the data colleceted here covers 1960-2013, and therefore does not reflect the establishment of this region.
The next most recently created regions are the Geita, Katavi, Njombe, and Simiyu Regions, all originating in 2012.
